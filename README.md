We highly recommend using the Docker version of DeepMEI as it eliminates the need for server configuration and dependency management. Our team updates the Docker version frequently to reduce hardware requirements. With version v1.6.6, DeepMEI can run smoothly on a personal computer with 16GB memory, I7 12700 CPU, and a 128GB SSD, analyzing 30x WGS sequence data of HG01529.final.cram from 1kGP phase 4 in just 30 minutes. If you require faster analysis, please let us know. In a bare metal with 32GB memory and 16 cores (32 threads), DeepMEI (for server) completes the same analysis in just 22 minutes.
